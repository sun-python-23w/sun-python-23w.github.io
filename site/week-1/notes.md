# TODO

- Maybe cut the `input()` stuff from the main material and mark it as something to cover if time allows ? / make it part of bonus objectives for the lab

    - Actually it's probably a *bad idea* to have bonus stuff push some people to get ahead
    - Probably should make bonus stuff unrelated to progress in the class
        - E.g., progress them on skills (or skill trees) that are not part of the spine of what the class will do
        - Example: ANSI colors
        
- Just do the string interpolation in the main lecture and then only have one lab instead of trying to bring the group back together ...?
