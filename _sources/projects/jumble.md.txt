## Instructions

1. Take a word from the user using `input()` and store it in a variable
2. Use `random.shuffle` to create a new variable that has the same letters as the original word but in a different order and print out the jumbled version.
3. Create a game loop (using `while`) that allows the player to guess what the original word is and prints out a success message when the user guess correctly.
